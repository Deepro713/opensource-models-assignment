DKubeX is a Kubernetes-based AI platform for the secure, private deployment of Generative AI applications, optimizing resource allocation, ensuring compliance, and integrating with existing pipelines in on-premises and private cloud environments. It provides a scalable and efficient infrastructure for managing AI workloads in enterprise settings.

DKubeX supports two main workflows: LLMOps and MLOps.

DKubeX provides a comprehensive set of features for building and deploying large language models (LLMs). These features include:

LLM Catalog: Access to multiple, ready to deploy open-source LLMs.
RAG: Build generative AI applications with your private data.
Fine-tuning: Train LLMs with your private data.
Serving: Deploy your custom, fine-tuned models on any of the LLMs provided in our catalog.
SecureLLM: Monitor requests & responses, collect RLHF data & track security & evaluation metrics.
SecureChat: Deploy multiple custom chat applications with any of the LLMs deployed on DKubeX.

DKubeX provides a comprehensive set of features for building and deploying traditional machine learning models. These features include:

Notebooks: Rapid experimentation with Jupyter, VSCode or R.
Pipeline Orchestration: Flyte or Kubeflow for streamlined workflows.
Training & Serving: Train & serve traditional ML models.

DKubeX provides a set of common tools that are shared between the LLMOps and MLOps workflows. These tools include:

Custom UI: Manage jobs and clusters through a user-friendly interface.
MLFlow: Track experiments and lineage.
Logs & Metrics UI: Troubleshoot workflows with custom logs and metrics.
Compute Resource Optimization: Optimize training/fine-tuning cost using SkyPilot.
Collaboration: Easily share workspaces between users.
